# Hindi-Text-Summarization
A Extractive Approach of Text summarization using frequency based and graph based model.

The objective of this project is to explore and compare two different models for generating concise summaries of Hindi text documents. The two models considered are the term frequency-based model and the graph-based model. 

The term frequency-based model involves the development of two sub-models. The first sub-model scores each sentence based on its frequency in the document, and an average score is calculated to determine a threshold value. Sentences with scores greater than the threshold are included in the final summary. This approach aims to capture the relevance and importance of each sentence based on its frequency within the text.

In the second sub-model of the term frequency-based approach, sentence scores are calculated by dividing the frequency of each word by the maximum frequency in the document. The n highest-scored sentences are selected to form the summary.This approach focuses on identifying the most significant sentences by considering the relative frequency of their constituent words.

The graph-based model, on the other hand, employs the TextRank algorithm and cosine similarity matrix. In this approach, a graph representation of the text is created, where sentences are nodes and edges are established based on the similarity between sentences. TextRank algorithm ranks the sentences based on their importance in the graph structure, considering both local and global context. The summary is generated by selecting the highest-ranked sentences
